# Death / Loss of loved one / Cycle of life

## Introduction
This meditation aims to help you find comfort and acceptance in the face of loss by contemplating these powerful analogies: "Returning to the Soil", "Tiny little nudges", and "Waves in the Ocean" It encourages reflection on how our existence and influence shape the world.

## Preparation

1. Find yourself a way to feel at peace and free to pursue complex thoughts. It might be while running in a forest, it might be lying on your bed, or you might prefer doing it while on a train.
2. Take a few deep, calming breaths. Checking whether your chest is rising by placing a hand over it may be helpful.
3. Clear your mind and let go.
4. Do some warm-up -- think of some neutral ideas that are easier for you to process and try to awaken your mind with them.

## Body of the Meditation

### Returning to the Soil

- Visualize your loved one as a part of a forest. They can be an oak tree, a deer, or a tiny sparrow.
- Imagine their life journey. Start by imagining how it became part of the environment.
- Try imagining you and others, also parts of this forest's biosphere, interacting with the loved one.
- Think of all the shade, nutrients, scents or songs they brought into the forest and how the forest grew with them and around them.
- Now, picture the plant or the animal leaving and returning to the soil, enriching it and nourishing the earth just as it did while it was alive.
- Recognize that your loved one's legacy, much like the enriched soil, will support the growth of new life and future generations.
- Recognize how, even after returning to the Soil, your loved one still shaped their surroundings and how these changes will forever make an impact.

### Tiny little nudges

You might be thinking about the far future right now -- won't everything they made fade away?

- Imagine asteroids floating in space.
- Sure, they might collide with each other, but this is a rare occurrence at best.
- At the same time, they are continuously bombarded with light and different particles.
- Their impact is small, but they give an asteroid these tiny little nudges that change their trajectory ever so slightly.
- In a grand scale of things, their impact might not seem that big. However, let's consider the grandest scale of things.
- In the far, far future, these billions of slightest of pushes might have caused two asteroids to collide.
- A single nudge was nothing by itself, but each and every one of them together was required to make two asteroids collide.

### Waves in the Ocean

Now, let's focus on something classic 

- Shift your focus to the idea of waves in the ocean.
- Imagine that each person is like a unique wave on the surface of the vast ocean.
- Reflect on how every wave, including your loved one, has a distinctive pattern and beauty.
- Contemplate that when a wave returns to the ocean, it becomes part of the vast, interconnected whole.
- Understand that, like your loved one, each person's energy and spirit are integrated into the universal tapestry, shaping the world.

## Conclusion

Take a few more deep breaths and sit with peace and acceptance.
Recognize that the energy and essence of your loved one are now an everlasting part of the universe. Remember that, even after leaving, their life and impact were and always will be real.
Whenever you need solace, return to this meditation to find comfort and connection.
